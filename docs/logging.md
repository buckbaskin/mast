# Logging

## Philosophy

The UI elements of the application are done via print, input

All other output should be done via `logging` which allows for the user to
control the level of logging published to the screen.

## Levels

### Debug

Everything, used for developing mast.py

### Info

General content for the interested user

### Warnings and Above

The default. Only outputs when the user should or must change their actions
